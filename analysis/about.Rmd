This tutorial was delivered online to members of the Department of Human
Genetics at the University of Chicago on Thursday, July 2nd, 2020.

It was a trial run of the tutorial that was later delivered on Thursday, July
23rd, 2020, as part of the virtual [useR! 2020][user!2020] conference.

[useR!2020]: https://user2020.r-project.org/

Substantial changes were made between this and the final version of the tutorial
in order to fit within 90 minutes and also better adapt to a virtual setting.
The final version of the tutorial is available as [Google Slides][final].
